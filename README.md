# Studyhelp:

My site is called StudyHelp and it is a company with paid services that is available to all students from all ages and levels adults, children, men, women. It's purpose is to make it easier for students that are facing difficulties and struggles in their studies and need extra help. 
In my project i used different coulours and the love running project inspired me in some way. I used black, red, white and charcoal which creates easier to read text while still giving enough contrast with background to be read by users with poor eyesight.
