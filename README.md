### bugs

**solved bugs**

- The homepage was refreshing every 10 seconds and that made the form wipes the inputs before the user can submit. And the was because of the meta refresh redirect. I moved it from the index.html file to the signup.html file. 

- At first i used float in my project and it gave me a bad positioning when using it and the content in every section was not aligned and put the way i intended to. Understanding and using flexbox made it a lot easier and gave me more flexibility.. 

**Unfixed Bugs**

- no bugs unfixed
